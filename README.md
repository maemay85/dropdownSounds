### About

Dropdown Sounds is an engaging way to explore the basics of harmonic theory and chords in contemporary pop/jazz music with the use of dropdown menues.

Users can click on a musical Key to see the chords and notes that belong to that key, and can further click on each Chord to see what notes make up that chord.

Users can also toggle chord complexity to view either Triads or 7th Chords.

Later versions with include audio, with hovering over a note or chord playing it out loud. This will be done using Tone.js
